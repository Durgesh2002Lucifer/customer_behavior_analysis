📊 Data Analytics Project – Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow starting from raw data ingestion to business insights and visualization.
The objective is to analyze customer shopping behavior, uncover trends, and present insights through SQL analysis and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The project covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying, dashboard creation, and reporting.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains customer transaction and behavior data, including:

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)

Product details (Category, Item Purchased, Size, Color)

Purchase details (Purchase Amount, Discounts, Shipping Type)

Engagement metrics (Review Rating, Subscription Status, Previous Purchases)

The data is structured and suitable for both SQL analysis and business intelligence reporting.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Data analysis queries

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and visualizations

Gamma – Presentation (PPT) generation

GitHub – Project version control and documentation

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps
1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas

Connected Python to SQL databases using SQLAlchemy

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked data structure, missing values, and distributions

Analyzed key metrics such as purchase amount, ratings, and customer segments

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Standardized column names and data types

Prepared clean data for SQL and Power BI

4️⃣ SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Performed analytical queries such as:

Revenue by gender

Subscription vs non-subscription spending

Discount impact on purchases

Top products and categories

Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard with:

Revenue and sales analysis

Category and product performance

Subscription insights

Age Group segmentation using DAX

Added slicers for dynamic filtering (Gender, Category, Shipping Type)

6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured analytics report

Designed a professional presentation (PPT) using Gamma to summarize insights for stakeholders

📊 Dashboard Highlights

Revenue breakdown by category and customer segment

Subscription impact on customer spending

Age Group analysis (Young, Adult, Middle Age, Senior)

Clean, business-oriented visuals for quick decision-making

📈 Key Results & Insights

Subscribed customers generate higher overall revenue

Certain product categories dominate sales performance

Discounts influence purchase frequency differently across products

Adult and middle-aged customers contribute the most revenue
